# umnbootcamp-project-1
This repo is a shared repo for UMN Data Analytics Bootcamp Project 1. The team chose to analyze whether or not various factors, such as location, year bottled, and price, influence the popularity of various wine brands.

The subject of this analysis is [Wine data sourced from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews), combined with Geocode data from Google. 

See our analysis, built using python scripting in a jupyter notebook, by opening the WineRatings.ipynb file. This file includes Google maps with details on the countries where Wine Ratings and Prices were recorded. To run the scripts in this notebook you will need a Google API Token: https://cloud.google.com/apis
